# Retro1.Org

This github repository is the collaboration space for development and conservation of various works as they relate to 
dtCyber, Hercules, (CYBIS) PLATO, and more.

Contributors to this project are identified in their respective repositories and specific roles will be identified here.

+ [Retro1.Org](https://retro1.org) is the "Root" Information Source of the retro1.org workspaces.
+ [Codex.Retro1.Org](https://codex.retro1.org) is the "Documentation Hub" of the retro1.org workspaces.

There are **Private** repositories here, maintained for contributing members only.  These are referenced by the 
previously mentioned web sites.

**Public** Repositories here are enhancements to or replicas of original codebases whose origins are contained in the
respective **README.md** files.

Forks of the repositories such as [DtCyber](https://github.com/kej715/DtCyber) are largely in-sync with their upstream parents and exist 
so the Retro1.Org participants may "try something" that may or may not be rededicated back to the upstream project.
